    Welcome to Cook Feast Repeat!

    Cook Feast Repeat is a user-friendly website that serves as a recipe library or database. Guests that visit the website are initially prompted to create an account or sign in. Upon completion, they are presented with the option to browse through our entire collection of recipes. If guests want to search for a single recipe (maybe recommended by a friend or to visit a previous recipe that they loved), they have the option to search for said recipe using a unique number id. Additionally, guests can also create / upload their own recipes consisting of a title, ingredient list, & description. 
    Cook Feast Repeat utilizies HTML, CSS, & JS code. For the CSS framework, we downloaded Pure CSS (a new technology for us). We also made use of Handlebars to dynamically generate our HTML page(s).
    Happy cooking, & more importantly, happy eating!
